    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am so glad you found yourself here! My name is Chloe Wilson and I am the owner and floral designer at Blossom & Vase. When I was a bride I had a specific vision for my wedding day, so I realize the value in having a florist who will take your dream and make it a reality, no matter how many Pinterest images and color schemes are brought to the table. There is nothing better than bringing a floral vision to life that is unique and stunning.
    <br>
    Passions in my life include florals, healthcare, and family. As a physician assistant, profits from Blossom & Vase go to fund medical mission trips and volunteer provisions for health care. I live out my days with my amazing husband, business partner, and pharmacist Tom Wilson.</p>
